    <h1>Welcome to the Electric Dynamite Network Tools website</h1>
    
    <p>
      Hello and welcome to this project's website.<br />
      Looking for the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ednt/">sourceforge project page</a>?
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>What is Electric Dynamite Network Tools (EDNT)?</h2>
      Electric Dynamite Network Tools is a small PHP/AJAX website, that you can install on your webserver to make it a fancy* Looking Glass<br />
      <span class="little">* Well, fancy compared to other Looking Glasses ;-)</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>What is a Looking Glass?</h2>
    A Looking Glass is a software, usually a website, that is used to get a view on the Internet from a certain point (the webserver) in the Internet.<br />
    This is most commonly used to trouble shoot routing issues or view the route back to some place (asynchronous routing). If you never heard of a Looking Glass, then you propably don't need one.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <h2>What licence does EDNT come with?</h2>
    Electric Dynamite Network Tools is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. Please see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <h2>So, what else do I need to run this?</h2>
    Basically what you need is a webserver with some kind of PHP5 running on it. You will need the following linux binaries (complete list to follow):<br />
    <ul>
    <li>traceroute</li>
    <li>tcptraceroute</li>
    <li>ping</li>
    <li>mtr</li>
    </ul>
    Besides that you have to be able to use sudo for some functions. You can also setuid the binaries, but I do not recommend that.<br />
    You will also need a BGP Router accessable using telnet. I am currently developing support for quagga, and will add support for Brocade/Foundry afterwards. This will propably make Cisco devices work too. I will add Junos syntax later.
    There might also be some Fortinet, but from there on I would need somebody to provide me access to a device for testing.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    <h2>Sounds good! Where can I download it?</h2>
    I am currently still working on the BGP module, which is propably the most important.<br />
    Once that is done I will most likely upload the first beta release.
